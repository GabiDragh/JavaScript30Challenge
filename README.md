# JavaScript30Challenge

My solved files for the vanilla JS 30 days challenge by Wesbos

## Day 1 - JavaScript drumkit done 

Different from personal style as all JS logic is being kept in the html script tag, not in the script.js file as I would usually code. 
Keeping it the same as in tutorial - makes things more interesting and getting out of comfort zone for a bit.

## Day 2 - Js and CSS clock done

First time working with the html, css and js code in one file. Finding it challenging as having to scroll up and down to see classes (not a fan of checking in console all the time, prefer to have them all in VS Code as separate split tabs).
Neat little clock done, added some if statements to solve the reset each minute issue. Also reduced the transition time to remove the flicker at minute change.

## Day 3 - CSS variables done

Nice lesson, found it helpful to see css variables update in browser automatically, using javascript logic (event listeners).

## Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1 done

Filter, map, sort, reduce through various arrays.

## Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery done

Playing with css flex and display to resize and create a text transition.

## Day 6 - Type Ahead done

Fetch a json file and filter through it to display the city and the population. Highlight the typed characters and display the population with a comma divider for better reading.

## Day 7 - !!!!! Array Cardio day 2 - skipped!!!!!

## Day 8 - Fun with HTML canvas done

Draw on HTML canvas and learn fundamentals on how it works and mouse events.

## Day 9 - Dev Tools Domination

Some dev very tools useful shortcuts. Fun lesson.

## Day 10 - Hold Shift to Check Multiple Boxes

ðŸ¤¯ Checklist hold shift and tick multiple boxes, both ways (up down and vice versa) -> needs a couple of re-reads and writing from memory to fully sediment. Concept not hard, though.
