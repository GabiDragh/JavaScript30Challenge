# JavaScript30Challenge

My solved files for the vanilla JS 30 days challenge by Wesbos

## Day 1 - JavaScript drumkit done 

Different from personal style as all JS logic is being kept in the html script tag, not in the script.js file as I would usually code. 
Keeping it the same as in tutorial - makes things more interesting and getting out of comfort zone for a bit.

## Day 2 - Js and CSS clock done

First time working with the html, css and js code in one file. Finding it challenging as having to scroll up and down to see classes (not a fan of checking in console all the time, prefer to have them all in VS Code as separate split tabs).
Neat little clock done, added some if statements to solve the reset each minute issue. Also reduced the transition time to remove the flicker at minute change.
