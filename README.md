# JavaScript30Challenge

My solved files for the vanilla JS 30 days challenge by Wesbos

## Day 1 - JavaScript drumkit done 

Different from personal style as all JS logic is being kept in the html <script> tag, not in the script.js file as I would usually code. 
Keeping it the same as in tutorial - makes things more interesting and getting out of comfort zone for a bit.
